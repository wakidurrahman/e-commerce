# ðŸš€ Performance Optimization

Essential performance techniques for e-commerce applications. Studies show 1-second delays reduce conversions by 7%.

## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics & Targets

**Core Web Vitals:**

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay):** < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** < 0.1
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint):** < 1.5s
- **TTI (Time to Interactive):** < 3.5s

**E-commerce Specific:**

- Product List Loading: < 1.2s
- Product Details: < 800ms
- Cart Updates: < 200ms
- Search Results: < 500ms

## âš¡ Essential Optimizations

### 1. Bundle Optimization

- **Code Splitting:** Route-based with Next.js App Router
- **Tree Shaking:** Remove unused code automatically
- **Dynamic Imports:** Load heavy components when needed
- **Bundle Analysis:** Monitor size with webpack-bundle-analyzer

### 2. Image Optimization

- **Next.js Image:** Automatic optimization and lazy loading
- **WebP Format:** Modern format with fallbacks
- **Blur Placeholders:** Improve perceived performance
- **Responsive Images:** Different sizes for different devices

### 3. Caching Strategies

- **React Query:** Cache API responses with smart invalidation
- **Service Worker:** Cache static assets for offline use
- **localStorage:** Persist cart and user preferences
- **HTTP Caching:** Proper cache headers for static assets

### 4. React Optimizations

- **React.memo:** Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **useMemo/useCallback:** Cache expensive calculations
- **Virtual Scrolling:** Handle large product lists efficiently
- **Suspense:** Better loading states with streaming

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Bundle size under 250KB for initial load
- [ ] Images optimized with Next.js Image component
- [ ] API responses cached with React Query
- [ ] Components memoized appropriately
- [ ] Code splitting implemented at route level
- [ ] Service worker configured for offline support
- [ ] Performance monitoring active in production
- [ ] Mobile performance tested on real devices

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Wins

1. **Use Next.js Image** for automatic optimization
2. **Enable React.memo** for expensive components
3. **Implement skeleton loaders** for better perceived performance
4. **Cache API responses** with React Query
5. **Minimize re-renders** with proper dependency arrays
6. **Use Web Workers** for heavy computations
7. **Monitor Core Web Vitals** continuously

Performance optimization is ongoing - measure first, optimize second, monitor always.
